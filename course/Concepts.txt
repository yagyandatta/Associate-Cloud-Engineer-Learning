Concepts:

1. IAAS-PAAS-SAAS  
-- PAAS model: Pay for what they use
-- IAAS model: pay for what they allocate
-- SAAS model: pay as per service consumption 

--- Serverless:
  i.  Cloud Run: It deploys containerized microservices based application in a fully-managed environments.
  ii. Cloud Run functions: Manages event-driven code as a pay-as-you-go service

2. Google Cloud Network: (42-regions || 127 AZs)

Geo-Location > regions > Zones

Geo-Location:
1. North America
2. South America
3. Asia
4. Europe > (europe-west2) > {europe-west2-a, europe-west2-b, europe-west2-c}
5. Australia

-- Google is the first one to achieve 'ISO 14001 certification' 
  

3. Security: (6-layers)
- Hardware infra layer
-- hardware design and provenance
-- secure boot stack
-- premises security

- Service deployment layer:
-- encryption of inter-service communication

- User identity layer
-- user identity (Log-in security)

- Storage layer
-- Encryption at rest

- Internet communication layer
-- Google Front End (GFE)
-- Denial of service (DoD) protection

- Operational security layer
-- intrusion detection
-- Reducing insider risk
-- Employee Universal Second factor (U2F) use
-- Software development practices 

7. Billing
- per-second billing (compute, gke)
- instance run for more than 25% of a month --> discount on every incremental minutes
- Google Cloud Cost Calculator 
- Features
-- Budgets (predefined budget)
-- Alerts (as per you have set budgets)
-- Reports (monthly usage report in more detailed way)
-- Quotas (per service to prevent from using wrong way)
